# Unexpected Hanging Paradox

The unexpected hanging paradox is a logical puzzle presented by mathematician Martin Gardner in 1963. Since then, it has been an active topic of debate in the math community. The paradox is as follows:
"There is a prisoner on death row. On Sunday, a judge tells him that he would be hanged at 12 noon on a weekday in the coming week. However, he also adds that the execution would be a surprise to the prisoner"

This paradox demonstrates the differences between mathematical logic and natural language.
